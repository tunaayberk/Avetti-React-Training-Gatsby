Ltd., a leading mobile phone provider, today announced the Samsung Galaxy S II (Model: GT-I9100), a thin (8.49mm), lightweight (116g), dual-core smartphone that combines an incredible viewing experience with fantastic performance. Running on Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), the Galaxy S II integrates Samsung&rsquo;s four content and entertainment hubs, for instant access to music, games, books, magazines and social networking services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simon Stanford, Managing Director, Mobile, Samsung UK and Ireland said: &quot;Following the huge success of our first Galaxy S handset last year, which sold in excess of 10 million units, we&rsquo;re aiming for its successor to become the ultimate smartphone. Featuring the fastest dual-core hardware, running on the quickest Android OS, with the most advanced screen on the market, we&rsquo;re providing our customers with a handset that will be unmatched in terms of both its hardware and content, thanks to our innovative content hubs.&rdquo;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Andy Rubin, Vice President of Engineering at Google, said: &quot;We're pleased to see Samsung bring another Android-powered device to market to help grow the Android ecosystem.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Featuring a dual-core processor, the Samsung Galaxy S II allows people to easily switch between applications and load popular web pages including Google, Yahoo and YouTube instantly, whilst superior 3D hardware means games and videos can be loaded quickly and smoothly. Super-fast HSPA + (21Mbps) connectivity and WiFi means increased download speeds on the device whilst BlueTooth 3.0 + HS considerably reduces data transfer times, the result being that people have immediate access to the content, people and services that are important to them. For anyone wanting to create their own content, the Galaxy S II features an 8 megapixel camera with 1080p HD recording and playback, and Samsung&rsquo;s patented AllShare technology lets them capture, create and then share their experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S II features Samsung&rsquo;s new crystal-clear 4.27&rdquo; Super AMOLED Plus screen which uses RealStripe technology so images look sharper and more detailed than before, making it an ideal mobile device for enjoying films and games. And, a significant reduction in power consumption means the device is more energy-efficient than other comparably-sized devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Galaxy S II features Samsung Hubs which provide people with a huge range of entertainment content, advanced mobile games and the ability to manage their online social life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Social Hub Premium: People can talk to who they want, how they want, all from one place. From here, people can sync their phonebook with their social networks, Instant Messenger and email accounts, and access all of their messages (push e-mail, text, VM and SNS) and respond directly without having to log into individual applications.&lt;br/&gt;- Readers Hub: Through strategic partnerships, Samsung&rsquo;s Reader&rsquo;s Hub provides over 2.2 million books and novels, 2000 global and local newspapers in 49 languages and 2300 popular magazines in 22 languages.&lt;br/&gt;- Game Hub: Featuring a 3-axis gyroscopic sensor, the Samsung Galaxy S is the perfect device for gaming fans. They can try new games for free, download premium titles from partners including Gameloft, play with friends using other devices and chat in-game with Social Network Games (SNG).&lt;br/&gt;- Music Hub: Access over 12 million tracks provided by 7digital, search for artists, get recommendations on new acts, and sample 30 or 60 second previews for free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the Samsung Galaxy S II, people can personalise their smartphone experience using the new Live Panel, a service that aggregates live web and application contents to a single customisable home-screen. Owners of the new handset can design the lay-out of their own Live Panel, whilst social networking feeds and applications can be embedded and accessed instantly through a magazine-like layout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New voice services on the Galaxy S II convert SMS texts to audio, whilst a Customised Voice Translation application makes the device perfect for taking on holiday, as it translates voice or text to &ndash; and from &ndash; a range of languages: just speak a word or phrase into the handset and it will instantly translate it, with audio and text output.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, Samsung&rsquo;s new Kies Air lets people manage their smartphone contents from their PC via local WiFi connections. Download photos taken on the handset&rsquo;s built-in camera, listen to music stored on the phone, check missed calls and send messages in the web browser on their PC. WiFi Direct also allows them to connect to wireless-enabled PCs and printers without the need for wireless access points.","properties":[{"Sys_Num_Images":"2"},{"UPC":"8806071418698"},{"Brand":"Samsung"},{"Gallery Images":"12"},{"Pdf Files":"0"},{"Depth":"8.49 mm"},{"Display diagonal":"10.8 cm (4.27\")"},{"Display resolution":"480 x 800 pixels"},{"Height":"125.3 mm"},{"Product colour":"Black"},{"USB 2.0 ports quantity":"1"},{"Weight":"116 g"},{"Width":"66.1 mm"},{"Wi-Fi":"Yes"},{"Battery capacity":"1650 mAh"},{"Processor frequency":"1.2 GHz"},{"Internal memory":"1.2 GHz"},{"Bluetooth":"Yes"},{"3G":"Yes"},{"Operating system installed":"Android 2.3"},{"Built-in camera":"Yes"},{"Image formats supported":"EXIF,JPG"},{"Face detection":"Yes"},{"2G standards":"EDGE,GSM"},{"Bluetooth version":"3.0+HS"},{"Data network":"3G"},{"Digital zoom":"4x"},{"FM radio":"Yes"},{"Form factor":"Bar"},{"MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service)":"Yes"},{"Music player":"Yes"},{"Rear camera type":"Single camera"},{"Ringer type":"Polyphonic"},{"Standby time (2G)":"610 h"},{"Talk time (2G)":"8.67 h"},{"3G standards":"HSDPA,HSPA,HSUPA"},{"Assisted GPS (A-GPS)":"Yes"},{"Auto focus":"Yes"},{"Flash type":"LED"},{"Front camera type":"Single camera"},{"GPS (satellite)":"Yes"},{"Instant messaging (IM)":"Yes"},{"Java technology":"No"},{"Maximum memory card size":"32 GB"},{"Personal info management (PIM)":"Alarm clock,Calculator,Calendar,Countdown timer,Notes,Stopwatch,To-do list"},{"Platform":"Android"},{"Position location":"Yes"},{"Rear camera flash":"Yes"},{"SIM card capability":"Single SIM"},{"Text prediction system":"Yes"},{"Text prediction system type":"T9"},{"Touchscreen":"Yes"},{"Vibrating alert":"Yes"},{"WAP":"Yes"},{"Headphone connectivity":"3.5 mm"},{"Video capture resolution (max)":"1920 x 1080 pixels"},{"Call timer":"Yes"},{"Conference call":"Yes"},{"Specific absorption rate (SAR) value (EU)":"0.33 W/kg"},{"Video call":"Yes"},{"Voice recording":"Yes"},{"Speakerphone":"Yes"},{"Photo effects":"Negative film,Sepia"},{"Voice commands":"Yes"}],"breadcrumbs":[{"name":"Home","url":"/"}],"frequentlyBoughtTogether":[],"accessories":[],"alsoLike":[],"reviews":[]},"url":"http://demob2b2cpreview.avetti.io/preview/product/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s-ii-gt-i9100-10-8-cm-4-27-single-sim-black-1650-mah-ainjn96yb3","productData":{"__Result":[{"additionalImages":"AINJN96YB3-2.jpg","allowBackOrders":false,"alsoLikeItems":[],"attributes":[],"available":true,"cimage":"https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/demob2b2cs3.avetti.ca/store/20180522154/assets/items/thumbnails/AINJN96YB3.jpg","code":"AINJN96YB3","discount":0,"discountItemGroup":"","discountItemType":"","enableDelOpts":"true","hiddenProperties":[{"itemid":0,"propdesc":"","propgroup":"","propid":0,"propname":"Created_By_Supplier","propnumber":165,"propvalue":"20181212828"},{"itemid":0,"propdesc":"","propgroup":"","propid":0,"propname":"Supplier_Item_Code","propnumber":166,"propvalue":"GT_I9100LKAFOP"},{"itemid":0,"propdesc":"Sys_Num_Images","propgroup":"","propid":0,"propname":"Sys_Num_Images","propnumber":159,"propvalue":"2"}],"image":"https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/demob2b2cs3.avetti.ca/store/20180522154/assets/items/images/AINJN96YB3.jpg","image3":"https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/demob2b2cs3.avetti.ca/store/20180522154/assets/items/largeimages/AINJN96YB3.jpg","itemId":295950,"itemid":295950,"longdesc":"Samsung Electronics Co.
